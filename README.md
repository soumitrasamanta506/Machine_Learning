# Machine_Learning
This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. Each algorithm is built step-by-step to demonstrate the core mathematical concepts, logic, and optimization techniques behind modern ML models — without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn.
